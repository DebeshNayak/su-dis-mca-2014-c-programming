1.b: Explain different types of data types available in C-language.

- Data types specify how we enter data into our programs and what type of data we enter.
- C language has some predefined set of data types to handle various kinds of data that we use in our program.
- These datatypes have different storage capacities.
- C language supports 2 different type of data types,
  1. Primary data types
  2. Derived data types

----------------
1. Primary data types:
  - These are fundamental data types in C namely integer(int), floating(float), character(char) and void.
  1.1. Integer:
  - Integers are used to store whole numbers.
  - Integer is also of two type:
    i. Signed Integer
      - This is again of three type: signed integer, short signed integer, long signed integer
    ii. Unsigned Integer
      - - This is again of three type: unsigned integer, short unsigned integer, long unsigned integer

  1.2. Floating:
  - Floating types are used to store real numbers.
  - These are of 3 type:
    i. Float
      - This can contain single-precision floating point value
    ii. Double
      - This contain double-precision floating point value
    iii. Long Double

  1.3. Character:
  - Character types are used to store characters value.

  1.4. Void type:
  - Void type means no value.
  - Or we can say it represents the absence of type.
  - This is usually used to specify the type of functions.
-------------------
2. Derive data types:
  - Derived data types are like arrays, functions, structures and pointers.
  2.1. Array
  - An array is a collection of data that holds fixed number of values of same type.
  - Example:
    float mark[100];
  - Array are of two types:
    i. One-dimensional array,
    ii. Multidimensional array

  2.2. Functions:
  - A function is a block of code that performs a particular task.
  - There are two types of functions:
    i. Pre-defined function (Library function)
    ii. User defined function

  2.3. Structure:
  - Structure is a collection of variables of different types under a single name.
  - Keyword 'struct' is used for creating a structure.

  2.4. Pointers
  - These are used in C program to access the memory and manipulate the address.

  2.5. Enumeration
  - An enumeration is a user-defined data type that consists of integral constants.
  - To define an enumeration, keyword enum is used.
