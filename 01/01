1.a: Write down the features of C-programming language.
Ans: C Programming is widely used in Computer Technology, We can say that C is inspiration
for development of other languages. We can use C for different purposes.
Below are some of the Features of C Programming –
1. Low Level Language Support
2. Program Portability
3. Powerful and Feature Rich
4. Bit Manipulation
5. High Level Features
6. Modular Programming
7. Efficient Use of Pointers

1. Low Level Features:
  - C Programming provides low level features that are generally provided by the
    Lower level languages.
  - C is Closely Related to Lower level Language such as “Assembly Language“.
  - It is easier to write assembly language codes in C programming.

2. Portability:
  - C Programs are portable i.e. they can be run on any Compiler with Little or no Modification.
  - Compiler and Preprocessor make it Possible for C Program to run it on different PC.

3. Powerful:
  - Provides wide verity of ‘Data Types‘
  - Provides wide verity of ‘Functions’
  - Provides useful control & loop control statements

4. Bit Manipulation:
  - C Programs can be manipulated using bits. We can perform different operations
    at bit level.
  - We can manage memory representation at bit level. [E.g.: We can use Structure to manage Memory at bit level]
  - It provides wide verity of bit manipulation operators.
  - We have bitwise operators to manage data at bit level.

5. High Level Features:
  - It is more User friendly as compare to Previous languages like BASIC, COBOL, FORTRANT.
  - Previous languages and other programming languages never provide such great features to manage data.
  - Previous languages have there pros and cons but C Programming collected all useful features of
    previous languages thus C become more effective language.

6. Modular Programming:
  - Modular programming is a software design technique that increases the extent
    to which software is composed of separate parts, called modules.
  - C Program consist of different modules that are integrated together to form complete program.

7. Efficient Use of Pointers
  - Pointers has direct access to memory.
  - C Supports efficient use of pointer
